      "intro" : "My name is Malin Andersson and I started the Technigo Bootcamp in January 2020. During the intense bootcamp I have learned JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Node.js. In addition, I have also leared SCSS and jQuery in my spare time. What makes me a great developer is that I am a very structured person and I am always curious to learn more and get feedback on my code. During the 24 week long education I made one project each week which gave me a lot of practical experience in coding! In bootcamp I have developed my projects using the latest industry standards and relevant technologies.", 
      "paragraph" : "I also have a Bachelor's degree in Human Resource Management from Karlstad University, as well as completed courses in English I, II and III. I have worked with customer service and sales since 2008. This experience has taught me how to help customers realize their needs and find suiting products."
